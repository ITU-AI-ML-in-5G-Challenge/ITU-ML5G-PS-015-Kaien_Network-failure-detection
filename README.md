Since the limitation of upload file within 25MB, the feature data set is divided into two files. Please following the steps to uncompress and setup the feature data's name:
1. Uncompress dataset_a.zip and dataset_bc.zip (it should be dataset_a.csv and dataset_a.csv after uncompressed)
2. Concate the two csv files into one file and please name it as 「dataset_abc.csv」
3. Create a new folder named csvFile and put feature 「dataset_abc.csv」 into it.
