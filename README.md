Since the limitation of upload file within 25MB (our feature dataset is 300MB), the feature data set is divided into two files. Please following the steps to uncompress and setup the feature dataset's name:
1. Uncompress dataset_a.zip and dataset_bc.zip (the file's name of features are dataset_a.csv and dataset_a.csv after uncompressed).
2. Concate the two csv files into one file and please name it as 「dataset_abc.csv」(the total size of this feature dataset should be 300MB).
3. Create a new folder named csvFile and put feature data file「dataset_abc.csv」 into it.
4. After above steps have been done, all of python code could be running well.
